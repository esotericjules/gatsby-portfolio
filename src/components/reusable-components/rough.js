                EPIBS is an extensive billing and payment settlement suite, that
                provides transparency and business accountability, which results
                in increased cash flow as well as better business intelligence
                for Ministries, Departments and Agencies.

                I worked as the frontend lead in this project and was
                responsible for ensuring an efficient workflow between the
                front-end and back-end engineers. I built the Invoicing Module,
                Settings Modules.

                A major challenge I experienced in this project was having to
                make constant iterations due to incomplete/unclear business
                requirements at the inception of the project. However as the
                project progressed iterations that had to be done reduced.
